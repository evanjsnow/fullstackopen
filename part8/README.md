Really enjoyed this section! GraphQL is really fun to work with. Here are some screenshots of what I put together:

Book List:
The genre filters are created dynamically by taking the array of all genres and extracting each unique genre, then a custom useIcon hook applies a specific icon to genres that are accounted for, or a generic icon for an unknown/new genre.

Filtered Book List:
This was the most challenging part of the class but I really enjoyed working it out.

Add New Book:
This is done in a "full-page modal dialog." Genres can be added all together by separating them with a comma.

Editing Author Birth Year:
This is done by clicking the calendar icon to display an inline form field.
