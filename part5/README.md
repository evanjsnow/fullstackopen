Hello! I finished everything in part5. If anyone is checking this and wants the actual code, please let me know. Maybe nobody is checking this at all. But in case someone is looking, I thought I'd share screenshots of the work instead of the actual code. I took a little extra time to customize the UI and add FontAwesome. Everything is working great. I had a really tough time getting the blog creator in the details section appear, but figured that out. Then I had a tough time getting the blog creator to not disappear after clicking like! Finally I set the blogCreator in the Blog component with useState instead of rendering it dynamically. Phew!
