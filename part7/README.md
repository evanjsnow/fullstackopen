Hello, I will upload the code from my Blogs app but I thought I would add some screenshots here:

Blog details:
(NOTE: I initially implemented the stand-alone blog page, but I preferred the show/hide details panel so I reverted to that and made the blog url clickable with a blank target)

Member/User details:
(NOTE: to circumvent the issue with user data from 7.15, I placed the data in a panel that can be toggled open/closed by clicking the member name, if the member has 0 blogs a message displays, otherwise their list of blogs displays)
