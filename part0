  participant BROWSER
  participant SERVER
  participant USER

  USER inititates field focus
  USER types into field
  USER invokes save button
  BROWSER-->>SERVER POST new note, activate server
  BROWSER-->>SERVER GET updated content (HTML w/ updated UL, css, JavaScript)
  SERVER-->>BROWSER updated content, deactivate server
  BROWSER refreshes to render updated content from step 12

0.5 SINGLE PAGE APP LOAD

Loading the SPA version is almost the same as the non-SPA version, except the initial browser-->server GET fetches different content
(spa instead of notes and spa.js instead of main.js)

0.6 SINGLE PAGE APP NEW NOTE

This is where the SPA version is much different than the non-SPA version

We can pick up from line 10
USER invokes save button
BROWSER executes JavaScript call stack
JavaScript displays the new note in the UL
BROWSER does not need to refresh
New note is displayed as part of the JavaScript function that was executed in the session
BROWSER-->>SERVER POST new note activate server
Deactivate SERVER
Next time the browser is refreshed and GET is called to fetch the data, the new note will be displayed within the data fetched from the SERVER, not from the previous session's JS execution
